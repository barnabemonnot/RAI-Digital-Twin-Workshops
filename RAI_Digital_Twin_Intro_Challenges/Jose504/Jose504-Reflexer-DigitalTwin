(conceptual) What are the advantages and disadvantages of breaking down the entire workflow on discrete steps of preparing -> backtesting -> identification -> prediction -> output?

If the linkages between modules are there then there is no other alternative but to do it in a required sequence.

*But there could be advanatges, especially in speed, if it could be done in parallel. Which could emerge when in future a real-time generation of the Stable Coin is required*

Could it be made differently?

*One variation I could try is
preparing -> backtesting -> **FORWARD TESTING** ->identification -> prediction -> output?*



(hands-on) Can you execute the RAI Digital Twin through the CLI? Does the output matches the one that we've seen on the slides?

*I hope to be able to do it before today's workshop.*


(hands-on) What happens if you use different CLI arguments?
For instance, what happens if extrapolation is done for 2 months rather than 2 weeks?

*Have not been able to try it as yet.*


Or if the past days to be downloaded are 3 days rather than 14 days?

*Have not been able to try it as yet.*

Any other relevant questions

*Not as yet.*
