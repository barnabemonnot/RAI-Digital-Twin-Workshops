- Can you plot the data used for historical backtesting / future extrapolation on a separate Jupyter notebook?
- What happens if you modify the `data/controller_params.csv` file? For instance, what happens if the simulation is ran with non-zero values on `ki` and `leaky_factor`? Or make kp go up or down?
- Are you able to modify the existing notebook template? What if we print summary statistics like the average Redemption Price over all the trajectory?
- Are you able to create a new notebook template that gets generated on each run?
